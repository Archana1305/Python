# Olympics Data Analysis 🏅📊

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Olympic Games** have a long and rich history, showcasing the best athletes from around the world. In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Olympic data to uncover key insights related to **participation trends, medal distributions, athlete demographics, and more**.

This analysis explores over **120 years of Olympic history** using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, with interactive visualizations to highlight important trends.

## 📂 Datasets Used
- **`athlete_events.csv`** – Contains details about athletes, including **age, gender, sport, event, medals won, and year of participation**.
- **`noc_regions.csv`** – Maps **NOC (National Olympic Committee) codes** to their respective regions.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis

✔ **Top 10 Participating Countries**: Identified the nations with the highest number of athletes over time.
✔ **Age Distribution of Athletes**: Analyzed age demographics and found the youngest and oldest medalists.
✔ **Gender Representation Over the Years**: Observed the increasing participation of female athletes.
✔ **Gold Medal Trends**: Uncovered dominant countries and sports with medalists aged 60+.
✔ **Rio 2016 Medal Count**: Analyzed top-performing countries in the most recent Olympic Games.
✔ **Athlete Physical Attributes**: Explored the relationship between **height, weight, and winning medals**.

## 📊 Data Visualization Examples

Here are some of the **key visualizations** from this analysis:

- **Top 10 Countries by Participation** (Bar Chart)
- **Age Distribution of Athletes** (Histogram)
- **Gender Distribution Over the Years** (Line Chart)
- **Gold Medals by Country** (Bar Chart)
- **Height vs Weight of Olympic Medalists** (Scatter Plot)
